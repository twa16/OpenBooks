=========
Open source billing solution for any business. We aim to replace the popular closed source solution.

There are three steps that I always try to follow when building applications:
    
1. Make it work
2. Make it pretty
3. Make it fast

Current Step: 1
Since we are at step one #####This code is ALPHA quality


There are a few pretty killer features that we will have:
- Multiuser support!
- OFX support(Bank synchronization) 
- Email integration
- PDF export
- Paperwork templates based on HTML and CSS
